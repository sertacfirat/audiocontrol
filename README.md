# Audio Control (v2.2)

**If you are a Headphone or Voice Chat user, sound options in Windows don't always trigger audio output device changes in WoW, and I know every second is precious when you are about to start combat. This is why I started this project for enabling instant sound adjustments!**

Tired of digging through the main game settings every time you want to adjust your sound? Audio Control provides a sleek, easy-to-access panel for managing your most common World of Warcraft sound settings!

This lightweight addon gives you quick control over your master volume, individual sound channels (Music, Ambience, Dialog), and even lets you switch your sound output device or reset the entire sound system on the fly, with helpful feedback directly in your chat window when the panel is closed.

    *   Download the latest version of Audio Control from the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/your-addon-slug) (LÃ¼tfen buraya kendi CurseForge linkinizi ekleyin).
    *   Alternatively, you can use an addon manager like the CurseForge App, WowUp, or others that support CurseForge addons.
2.  **Extract the Addon (if downloaded manually):**

3.  **Place the Addon Folder:**
    *   Navigate to your World of Warcraft installation directory.
    *   Inside, go to the `_retail_` (for modern WoW) or `_classic_` (for Classic versions) folder.
    *   Then, go into the `Interface` folder, and finally into the `AddOns` folder.
    *   Copy the "AudioControl" folder (the one extracted in step 2) into this `AddOns` folder.
    *   The final path should look something like: `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\AudioControl`
4.  **Enable the Addon in Game:**
    *   Launch World of Warcraft.
    *   On the character selection screen, click the "AddOns" button in the bottom-left corner.
    *   Find "Audio Control" in the list and make sure the checkbox next to it is ticked (checked).
    *   If you want it enabled for all characters, select "All" from the dropdown at the top of the AddOns window before checking the box.
    *   Click "Okay" and log in to your character.
5.  **First Use:**
